This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: the misuse of `unsafePerformIO` within a pure function.  The original `bug.hs` file exhibits this error, leading to potential non-determinism and unexpected results. The `bugSolution.hs` file presents a corrected version, showcasing how to achieve the desired functionality while maintaining Haskell's purity and referential transparency.
